Quote from 
"In Table 2, we display the results of  this simulated residential model, finding that approximately 68% of the high risk census blocks
had building fire incidents. However, as nearly 83% of census blocks had a prediction probability
greater than 0.5, this suggests a more nuanced approach to risk score discretization may be required.
Additionally, because census blocks may contain hundreds of residential properties, there may
be multiple fire incidents, suggesting that a binary classification approach may not be the most
appropriate or effective. For our 6 performance metrics across each simulated model iteration, we
show the raw values (Figure 12), the mean values (Figure 13), and the standard deviation (Figure 14)."
